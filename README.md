# xBDR: Expected Batter Decision Runs

**Can we OBJECTIVELY measure when a baseball player should swing at a pitch? Seeking to add clarity to an overlooked area of sabermetrics, I developed a method to gauge an MLB player’s plate approach by applying the run expectancy matrix and principles of expected values to each pitch batter faces. After analyzing a staggering 1,500,000 pitches, I produced results that may change how we value plate approach and its effect on offensive production. The entirety of my process and results are detailed in my full report linked below. For presentability, I condensed my report into a YouTube video so that it might appeal to both sabermetric experts and baseball novices alike.

## Abstract

---

In Major League Baseball, advanced metrics have a gap when it comes to evaluating a batter’s plate discipline. This study introduces xBDR (expected Batter Decision Runs), a metric that measures a batter’s decisions to swing at or take pitches given the game state and the pitch type and location. Using the count-sensitive RE288 matrix, the model uses expected values to calculate the run value of every possible result of a swing or take, uninfluenced by the actual outcome of the pitch. The difference in expected runs before and after a batter’s decision estimates the run value of each choice. For a single season, each player earns an xBDR representing the total runs contributed by their batting decisions that year. Linear regression reveals xBDR as an effective predictor of both individual batting success and wins on a team-level. Furthermore, xBDR is more consistent than other sabermetrics on a year-to-year basis, making it a reliable indicator of underlying skill, independent of luck and hot streaks. xBDR shows potential in underperforming players by revealing discrepancies between batted ball data and offensive production. xBDR aims to offer currently unexplored insights into plate approach for the future of baseball.
